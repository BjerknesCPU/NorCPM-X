20130805: NorESM modifications of the CESM1_0_4 system:

* Modified ./models/ice/cice/bld/build-namelist and 
  models/ice/cice/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml to 
  allow more flexible output specification for cice (Ingo Bethke). 

* Added machine specific configurations for hexagon.bccs.uib.no
  (hexagon) and vilje.hpc.ntnu.no (vilje) in the file
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/config_machines.xml (Mats Bentsen).

* Added files Macros.hexagon*, env_machopts.hexagon*, mkbatch.hexagon*,
  Macros.vilje, env_machopts.vilje, mkbatch.vilje, under
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines with machine dependent settings for
  hexagon and vilje (Mats Bentsen).

* Added tasks/thread setup for hexagon and vilje in
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/config_pes.xml (Mats Bentsen).

* In order to enable use of intel compiler on hexagon and vilje the
  following files were modified:
  ./models/utils/pio/configure
  ./models/utils/pio/aclocal.m4
  ./models/utils/mct/configure.ac
  ./models/utils/mct/configure
  ./models/utils/mct/aclocal.m4

* Modified ./scripts/create_newcase so that subversion information about
  the CCSM root directory is recorded in the case directory (Mats
  Bentsen).

* Created the directory ./scripts/README.NorESM containing NorESM
  specific documentation and modified ./scripts/create_newcase to copy
  the documentation to the case directory (Jens Debernard).

* Modified ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template/config_definition.xml and
  ./scripts/create_newcase and added
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools/noresm_l_archive.bash so that a NorESM
  specific long term archiving script is generated (Mats Bentsen).

* In ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools/ccsm_buildexe.csh the run directory
  is set to use striping, that is to use all Object Storage Targets
  (OSTs), when the system is configured on hexagon (Mats
  Bentsen).

* Modified ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template/config_definition.xml and
  generate_batch.csh and ccsm_postrun.csh under
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools for restart functionality without
  resubmission (Mats Bentsen).

* Created the directory ./models/ocn/micom containing the ocean
  component MICOM (Mats Bentsen).

* Modified config_definition.xml and ConfigCase.pm under
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template so that MICOM is listed as a
  possible ocean component and MICOM tracer modules can be enabled in
  component sets (Mats Bentsen).

* Added component sets specific for NorESM in
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template/config_compsets.xml. The name of
  the NorESM component sets starts with "N".  Modified
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/config_pes.xml so it contains
  task/thread setup for the new component sets on hexagon.bccs.uib.no
  (Mats Bentsen).

* Modified ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/Macros.hexagon so it contains
  compiler options for MICOM (Mats Bentsen).

* Modified ./scripts/create_newcase to enable handling of template files
  for MICOM (Mats Bentsen).

* Modified ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools/configure so that MICOM can be
  configured for the number of tasks that are defined in the case
  specific env_mach_pes (Mats Bentsen).

* Modified ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools/st_archive.sh so that MICOM
  restart and history files will be archived. Modified some file
  operations to by executed on the compute nodes when the system is
  configured on hexagon.bccs.uib.no (Mats Bentsen).

* Modified ./models/ice/cice/bld/build-namelist and
  namelist_definition.xml and namelist_defaults_cice.xml in
  ./models/ice/cice/bld/namelist_files to enable setting of an CICE
  namelist parameter that determines if fresh water and salt fluxes from
  frazil ice formation should be included (Mats Bentsen).

* In order to include the CORE2 interannual forcing paths were modified
  in ./models/atm/datm/bld/datm.template.streams.xml (Mats Bentsen).

* Modified ./models/lnd/clm/bld/build-namelist to allow grid dependent
  namelist values to be specified in use-cases (Mats Bentsen).

* Under ./models/ice/cice/src/source, ice_diagnostics.F90 were modified
  to add diagnostics of salt and ice_history.F90 and
  ice_history_fields.F90 were modified to add history file definitions
  (Jens Debernard).

* Created the directory ./models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam_oslo containing
  CAM-Oslo specific routines (Oyvind Seland).

* Modified ./models/atm/cam/bld/configure and
  ./models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/definition.xml and added file
  ./models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/defaults_aer1850online.xml to
  allow for CAM-Oslo configuration (Oyvind Seland).

* Added NorESM specific CAM namelist files under
  ./models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases (Mats Bentsen)

* Added NorESM specific CLM namelist files under
  ./models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/use_cases (Mats Bentsen)

* In order to support the tripolar ocean/sea-ice grid tnx1v1 the
  following files were modified:
  ./models/atm/datm/bld/datm.cpl7.template,
  ./models/ice/cice/bld/cice.cpl7.template,
  ./models/ice/cice/bld/cice_decomp.xml,
  ./models/ice/cice/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cice.xml,
  ./models/ice/dice/bld/dice.cpl7.template,
  ./models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/checkdatmfiles.ncl,
  ./models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_clm.xml,
  ./models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_datm.xml,
  ./models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml,
  ./models/lnd/dlnd/bld/dlnd.cpl7.template,
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template/config_grid.xml, and
  ./scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/config_pes.xml.

* TURB_FLUX_SCHEME flag is added to shr_flux_mod.F90 and following files
  are modified (Alok)
  ./models/drv/driver/ccsm_comp_mod.F90
  ./models/drv/shr_esmf/esmfshr_infodata_mod.F90
  ./models/drv/shr/seq_infodata_mod.F90
  ./models/drv/bld/cpl.template
  ./models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
